AliasVault is an end-to-end encrypted password and alias manager that protects your privacy by creating alternative identities, passwords and email addresses for every website you use. The core of AliasVault is built with C# ASP.NET Blazor WASM technology. AliasVault can be self-hosted on your own server with Docker.

### What makes AliasVault unique:
- **Zero-knowledge architecture**: All data is end-to-end encrypted on the client and stored in encrypted state on the server. Your master password never leaves your device and the server never has access to your data.
- **Built-in email server**: AliasVault includes its own email server that allows you to generate virtual email addresses for each alias. Emails sent to these addresses are instantly visible in the AliasVault app.
- **Alias generation**: Generate aliases and assign them to a website, allowing you to use different email addresses and usernames for each website. Keeping your online identities separate and secure, making it harder for bad actors to link your accounts.
- **Open-source**: The source code is available on GitHub and can be self-hosted on your own server.

> Note: AliasVault is currently in active development and some features may not yet have been (fully) implemented. If you run into any issues, please create an issue on GitHub.

## Live demo
A live demo of the app is available at the official website at [app.aliasvault.net](https://app.aliasvault.net) (up-to-date with `main` branch). You can create a free account to try it out yourself.

## Installation

To install AliasVault, the easiest method is to use the provided install script. This will download the pre-built Docker images and start the containers.

### 1. Install using install script

This method uses pre-built Docker images and works on minimal hardware specifications:

- Linux VM with root access (Ubuntu or RHEL based distros recommended)
- 1 vCPU
- 1GB RAM
- 16GB disk space
- Docker installed

```bash
# Download install script
curl -o install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lanedirt/AliasVault/main/install.sh

# Make install script executable and run it. This will create the .env file, pull the Docker images, and start the AliasVault containers.
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh install
```

### 2. Post-Installation

The install script will output the URL where the app is available. By default this is:
- Client: https://localhost
- Admin portal: https://localhost/admin

> Note: If you want to change the default AliasVault ports you can do so in the `.env` file.

## Detailed documentation

## Security Architecture
<a href="https://docs.aliasvault.net/architecture"><img alt="AliasVault Security Architecture Diagram" src="docs/assets/diagrams/security-architecture/aliasvault-security-architecture-thumb.jpg" width="343"></a>

AliasVault takes security seriously and implements various measures to protect your data:

- All sensitive user data is encrypted end-to-end using industry-standard encryption algorithms. This includes the complete vault contents and all received emails.
- Your master password never leaves your device.
- Zero-knowledge architecture ensures the server never has access to your unencrypted data

For detailed information about our encryption implementation and security architecture, see the following documents:
- [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
